# Facebook Messenger PWA

Convert Facebook Messenger web version into installable PWA. (inspired from [slack-pwa](https://github.com/gxanshu/slack-pwa))

## Why

I don't want 10 instances of Chrome/Chromium running on my pc.

## How to install

> Note you will need chromium based browser to install this

1. Install from [webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/messenger-pwa)
7. Open [messenger web version](https://www.messenger.com), hard reload it (**CTRL + SHIFT + R**)
8. If it still does not work, clear the cache & cookies of messenger and login again.
9. You will see install PWA button in the URL bar - click, install, and you are ready to go.
